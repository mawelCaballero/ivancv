I'm an experienced technical analyst and software engineer, with a solid technical background,
particularly in Java and J2EE environments with an important background in agile development
methodologies, Maven, Spring and quality assurance tools.

I've got more than 14 years of experience, working on first line international projects, for main companies and public agencies across Europe. 

Highly interested and motivated for learning new technologies and improve my technical skills.
